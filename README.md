# 🤪 Useless Project — Emoji Login + Papadam Bump Counter

A delightfully useless web project that combines two unrelated concepts:  
*Emoji-based Facial Expression Login 🎭 + Papadam Bump Detection using OpenCV 🍘*  
Perfectly weird and pointlessly fun!


## Basic Details  
**Bug Busters:**

## Project Description  
A fun pastel-themed web app where you log in using facial expression emojis and a pinky promise. Once logged in, upload a papadam image, and the app uses OpenCV and Matplotlib to count the bumps. A playful fusion of computer vision and creative UI! 
---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Too many papadams are being served without proper quality control. How many bumps are too many? No one knows. Meanwhile, traditional logins using passwords or OTPs feel boring and insecure… wouldn’t your face (literally) be a better password? Clearly, the world was missing a papadam quality tester and a facial emoji password system.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
A facial expression recognition-based login system with a pinky promise captcha — plus, a bump counter that lets you analyze your papadam crispiness. Yes, really.
